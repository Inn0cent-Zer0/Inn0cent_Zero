# Hi, I'm Vaish 👋

I’m learning how to **turn my ideas, projects, and learnings** into a GitHub portfolio that truly represents me.  
My focus right now is on:
- 📚 Sharpening my coding skills
- 🔐 Exploring cybersecurity & ethical hacking tools
- 🛠 Building small but meaningful projects
- 📂 Documenting everything here so others can learn too

💡 My goal: To grow this profile into a space that shows not just my code, but my **progress**.
